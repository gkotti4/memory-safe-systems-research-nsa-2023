# Memory-Safe Systems Research (NSA Program · Fall 2023)
This repository contains research conducted as part of an NSA-sponsored project examining how memory-safe programming languages influence system software security. The study compares traditional low-level languages such as C and C++—which rely heavily on manual memory management—to modern memory-safe languages such as Rust and Go, which provide structural guarantees that prevent many classes of memory-related vulnerabilities by design.


The work focuses on understanding: 

- What “memory safety” means in practice 
- Why memory issues occur in low-level languages 
- How different languages handle memory allocation, lifetime, and deallocation 
- Which vulnerabilities are reduced—or entirely eliminated—by memory-safe language semantics 
- Practical trade-offs when adopting memory-safe languages for systems-level work 

> *Note:* This was a university research project completed as part of an NSA-sponsored academic program.

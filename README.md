# memory-safe-systems-research-nsa-2023
This project is a research study conducted as part of an NSA-sponsored program exploring memory safety in systems programming languages. Our team evaluated how language-level safety guarantees (e.g., Rust) compare to traditional unsafe languages (e.g., C/C++) in preventing real-world vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, and data races.
